# HACK: Disabled to allow for building on Darwin
# breaks compilation on linux env
# when cross compiling for darwin
# Unsure what community standards exist for making this portable.
# 
# On Darwin, set ENV as follows to override:
# export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="clang"
# export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_APPLE_DARWIN_AR="ar"
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
linker = "x86_64-apple-darwin15-clang"
ar = "x86_64-apple-darwin15-ar"

# On Darwin set ENV for cross compilation after following instructions:
# http://timryan.org/2018/07/27/cross-compiling-linux-binaries-from-macos.html
# export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_LINKER="x86_64-linux-musl-gcc"
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
# linker = "x86_64-linux-musl-gcc"
